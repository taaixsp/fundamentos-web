            <h2 class="center">Biography</h2>
            <p class="justify">While at the Carrucan Plantation, Django and Broomhilda's 
                plantation owner taunts them for their marriage, so the couple attempted an escape, 
                though they were eventually captured, brutally branded with the letter "r" on their cheeks 
                (for "runaway"), and sold for different slavers. Django was sold to the Speck Brothers, 
                Ace and Dicky at the Greenville Auction House, along with several other slaves. 
                After marching through the country for days, the Specks and the slaves were approached by a 
                wandering dentist, Dr. King Schultz. Schultz, truly being a bounty hunter, is looking for 
                The Brittle Brothers, Django's former slavers, whom he could easily recognize. 
                The Specks refuse to sell Django, then threatens Dr. Schultz as they order him to leave, 
                Dr. Schultz Quickly draws his weapon, killing Ace and injures Dicky. 
                He then frees Django allowing him to assist him in their adventure, he also frees the other 
                slaves leaving them to finishing off the remain Speck Brother. Dr. Schultz and Django take off 
                to the Brittles' current location, Bennet Plantation, and Django is promised his freedom and 
                payment for his service.</p>
