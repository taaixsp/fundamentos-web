    You all know I love Harry Potter, right? 
    Well, today I decided to bring you a little bit about my favorite book and movie of the whole series: 
    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

<h3 class="center"> Why I love it </h3>
   <p class="justify">
    There are some reasons why I love this book: the most important is that, in my opinion, this is the book in which Harry notices he has a huge battle to fight. 
    Besides that, it’s also when you can see the switch from childhood to young adulthood in them; 
    they’re all forced to go through situations that make them grow internally, which is more visible on the following book (but that’s a topic to another post).
    Moreover, it’s on this book that Sirius dies, which is, in my humble opinion, the worst loss Harry has in the whole saga (besides his parents’, of course).
    For me, the epic moment on this book happens when Voldemort possesses Harry in front of Dumbledore and Harry’s friends, asking Dumbledore to kill them, 
    while Harry is in terrible pain; and here is where magic happens: 
    I’d rather see this scene on the movie than to read it on the book, because on the movie Harry fights against Voldemort, saying he’s week and alone, 
    and that he’ll never know what happiness, loyalty and true love are, while on the book he just mourns in pain.
    Anyways, I love it and I hope you had enjoyed my writing! Here are the parts of the book and the movie scene I told you above. Thanks a million! xoxo

    <h3 class="center"> Chapter 36 </h3>
    <h3 class="center"> The only one he ever feared </h3>
<p class="justify">
(…) For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. 
Harry could not see why: the hall was quite empty but for themselves, 
the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue, 
and the baby phoenix Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor—' 
Then Harry's scar burst open and he knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, 
pain past endurance— He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, 
so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creatures began: 
they were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape— And when the creature spoke, 
it used Harry's mouth, so that in his agony he felt his jaw move ... 'Kill me now, Dumbledore ...' 
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the creature use him again ... 
'If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy ...' Let the pain stop, thought Harry ... let him kill us ... 
end it, Dumbledore ... death is nothing compared to this ... And I'll see Sirius again ... 
And as Harry's heart filled with emotion, the creatures coils loosened, the pain was gone; 
Harry was lying face down on the floor, his glasses gone, shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood ... 
And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than there should have been ... 
Harry opened his eyes, saw his glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him, 
but which now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile. He put them on and raised his head a little to find 
Dumbledore's crooked nose inches from his own. 'Are you all right, Harry?' 'Yes,' said Harry, 
shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly. 'Yeah, I'm —where's Voldemort, 
where—who are all these—what's—' The Atrium was full of people; the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames 
that had burst into fire in all the fireplaces along one wall; and streams of witches and wizards were emerging from them. 
As Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet, Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin, 
leading a stunned-looking Cornelius Fudge forward. 'He was there!' shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail,
 who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall, where Bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before. 
 'I saw him, Mr. Fudge, I swear it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and Disapparated!' 
 'I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too!' gibbered Fudge, who was wearing pyjamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles.
  'Merlin's beard—here—here!— in the Ministry of Magic!—great heavens above—it doesn't seem possible—my word—how can this be—?' (…)
